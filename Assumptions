1. I wasn't sure what you meant by "2 square wall". So I just have two walls on
each side of the canvas and the ball bounces of the walls. There is unfortunately
no real physics. It just bounces of the walls ( and also the top/botton of the
canvas.) Realy not sure if my assumptions are correct here.

2. No browser capability detection

3. Tested on Firefox 13 and Chrome 19 - OS X Lion.

4. I couldn't find a way to draw borderless shapes using Canvas API.
Hence I update/repaint the whole canvas at each interval. Ideally, if I could
I would updated/repainted only the ball bit on canvas.
